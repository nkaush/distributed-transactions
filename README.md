## Build Instructions:

1. You must first have the Rust compiler (rustc) and Cargo installed. You can either run `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh` to install these or visit https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install for more installation options. Follow the instructions for the default installation of Rust when prompted.
2. If you are installing Rust for the first time, you will also need to run the following command to add `cargo` to your path for the current shell/session: `source "$HOME/.cargo/env"`
3. Run `make` in the project root directory. This will build 2 executables `./server` and `./client`.
